# !fa-tasks Jobs

Jobs are for task planning. Create a new job to inform other users (and yourself!) of pending tasks like field work. Other
users are informed eg. to remove their installations when a field is plowed or they can organize transport.


## Logs from jobs
It is often important to trace certain actions into the past - to understand surprising results (why is my ground air temp 
suddenly fluctuating much stronger than before? Aah - harvest & plowing). Jobs are plans for the future - if they are done, 
they're gone. You can record the task as a fact of the past as a log-entry (help:dataset/log ). This can be done automatically using the 
log-to-site-feature of the job. 


## Messenges from jobs

If a job is past due, reminders will be sent out. Select with the checkboxes in the "send message" part, who should get 
the reminder, the job author (who created the job), the responsible user or 

Jobs can send out messages automatically sometime before they are due. Just select the [topics](..) of the message 
(or create a new topic) and when the messages will go out. If you change something important on your job, eg. the 
due date, send an update directly out of the job page to everyone who subscribed to the topics of the job.
