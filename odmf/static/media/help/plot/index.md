# Plotting data

Plots are the prime place to get data - either for visual inspection or for
export. Plots are defined with general properties !fa-cog , subplots and 
lines. The lines define the data to be shown.

## !fa-chart-line The plot content

### Subplots

You start  with an empty plot and you can !fa-plus-circle add subplots (common time axis) to the plot. The subplot can be changed with:

- !fa-trash : delete subplot
- <i>y</i>&#x2195 : set y axis to a fixed range
- !fa-tags : show log messages for a certain site

### Lines
Then you !fa-plus-circle add data lines to the subplot. You can leave the name of
a line empty. Select the datassets by valuetype, site, level and instrument.
In case of an aggregated plot, ypu can select one of the aggregation functions.

Use markers, line styles, colors and width to seperate lines in a subplot visually.

After creation of a line you can click on it to drop down the line tools:

- !fa-trash : remove line
- !fa-list : show datasets of this line
- !fa-edit : Change the line properties
- !fa-copy : Copy this line and start editing


## !fa-cog Properties

Here you describe how the plot as a whole functions, which timespan, the layout of subplots, the aggregation and you can describe the figure

### !fa-clock Time span

Select the timespan for the plot. 

## !fa-file load / save plot

Give the subplot a name and select a fitting directory in the filemanager. Plot files can be opened
from the file manager also.

## !fa-file-export Export data

See help:export
