# !fa-tags Logs

The records of a dataset are numeric values of a certain [valuetype](../valuetype). But often qualitative information
must be saved at site, too. Eg. when was a certain field operation done? Last cleaning of an optical device or anything
else. Logs are created at a site. You can create a new log entry from the [site page](/site/1#messagelist) or directly
at the [log page](/log).

## Who, when and where?

The user who reports the logged event - this is usually yourself, but if you need to report on behalf of someone
else, this can be changed. Enter the date and time of the events - if you can add it right when it happens nothing needs
to be typed. And select the site where it happened.

## Log type

Each log has a type to group similar types, eg. field operations, qualitative observations, maintenance tasks etc. Try
to reuse existing types to make searching easier. 

## Description

Add any text to describe this event. You can use markdown like everywhere.

## Logs from Jobs

Logs are facts of the past - not plans for the future. If you are planning a certain activity that will become a log
entry, when done, use a [!fa-tasks job](/help/messenger/job). Jobs have types, too and can create logs for one or more
sites automatically when marked as done.

## Import logs from tables

You can import logs from tables if a time, site and type column is present. Add a message column to make it more meaningful
