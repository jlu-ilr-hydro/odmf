#### What is a wiki

A wiki is the idea of a interlinked knowledge base, written by many people together, online. The most
famous is of course the [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org). The schwingbach wiki is somewhat simpler. 
Just upload files containing your content with a useful file name in this directory.

#### Files

The wiki folder is for storing plain [markdown][1] text pages, that can be linked 
from any other [markdown][1] source. The files need to have the extension .wiki and 
should not reside in a subdirectory.

#### Linking to a wiki-page.

From any [markdown][1] source (eg. comments, other wiki pages, directory index) you can link 
to wiki pages by writing `help:test` to link  the file help.wiki. The result is like this: wiki:help
