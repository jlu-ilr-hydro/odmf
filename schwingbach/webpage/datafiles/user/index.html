**Special data:**

create a new folder with your user name.
Use sufficient filenames, to understand the meaning. You can create a help text like this, by clicking in the window. 

Please consider the following options for upload:

* Your data is collected at serveral (existing) sites and should append existing datasets. Use the template for routine measurements. Make sure your filename ends with _log.xls
 * Your data is collected at several sites, that are distributed over the study area. There is little or no chance data will collected at exactly this site again.
At the moment, there is no way to include this type of data in the database. Just do an upload to the server and write a small description of your data in an index.html file, and upload it also.
