In some places, eg. comments [Markdown][1] syntax can be used to 
enhance the appearance of the text. **But you don't need to care!**

This help page is written using Markdown, see [here][3] to see this page as source code



Creating links
--------------------

 * `file:user/index.html` links to a file on the server. Use this to link to manuals, thesis etc. ==> file:user/index.html 
 * `dir:user/philipp` links to a directory on the server ==> dir:user/philipp 
 * `ds370` links to a dataset ==> ds370 
 * `#18` links to a site ==> #18
 * `job:1` links to a job ==> job:1
 * `photo:1` links to a photo ==> photo:1
 * `![title](/picture/thumbnail/1)`inserts a small version of a photo ==> ![title](/picture/thumbnail/1)
 * `user:philipp` links to a user page ==> user:philipp
 * `[link name](http://uni-giessen.de)` links to another web site. ==> [link name](http://uni-giessen.de)
 * `[title](/map)` links to a location on this site ==> [title](/map) 
 * Just write the link address - it will be converted automatically to a link, eg. http://uni-giessen.de



Formatting
---------------

 * Starting a line with \* can be used for a list. Like this one.
 * You can *emphasize* or **strong emphazise** text in this way: `*emphasize*` or `**strong emphazise**`
 * You can insert a line break by doing two line breaks in your text
 * You can insert a horizontal line by `------` on a single line 
 * You can use arrows like this `--> ==> <-- <==` to get this --> ==> <-- <==
 * You can insert warnings, errors and boxes. See below.
 * You can do some more stuff with Markdown, have a look [here][1] and [here][2] or at the [source for 
    this page][3]
